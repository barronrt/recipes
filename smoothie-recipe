Take two cups of frozen fruit(I recommend general medley- 
peaches, grapes, pineapple, melon, strawberry. Some like 
berry heavy mixes, but I find the raspberry or blackberry
 heavy mixes have too much large grit)


 two cups orange juice(or V8 splash<--(highly
  recommended), or milk, or water )


  one or two cups yogurt(Plain or, if you dare, try some
   different flavor combos)


  One or two moderately ripe bananas.  Green bananas are
  not advised.  (this is actually the perfect place for
   those bananas that are almost too ripe, if you know 
   what i mean.)

Fill remainder of pitcher with water, milk, or juice, and
blend- yummy

Now, for a less high sugar option, try adding some ice
cubes instead of frozen fruit, and use the diet V8 or
 other juice.

And to be the summer dessert champion, remove 1/2 of each 
of the ingredients above, and replace with vanilla ice
cream.  whoot whoot!
